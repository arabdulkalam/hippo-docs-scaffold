#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 7a

##What we’ve done

We designed this prototype in order to:

Explore and understand recently qualified FE teachers’ experience of getting into FE

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Recruitment very casual or speculative
- Users’ employers VERY active in organising quals and training
- Very limited awareness of QTLS (1/4)
- Qualifications described as level 5, level 7 (definitely not PGE)
- Word of mouth from peers and managers for much advice & guidance re quals
- Inconsistency of use of teacher/lecturer as a name for the job
- Kudos of L7 qualification mentioned as aspirational
- Desire to ‘trade up’ qualifications seems to be an ambition
- Use of phone and laptop described as both involved in researching jobs/qualifications
- Suggestion of completing a level 3 qualification as part of researching FE

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

Tables, contents and quick links as a way of organizing information surrounding FE teaching qualifications

###Our users told us:

- First impression: bland and uninspiring
- DfE logo gives authority and confidence in usability
- Suggestion of a pre-set process again appreciated
- Drop down content from steps disturbed one user
- Mention of age 14+ prompted questions
- Within table layout, description of assessments called for in addition to teaching hours
- One users disturbed by suggestion of being able to work without qualification
- Top nav worked well for ¾ - and badly for the fourth
- Call for a stronger purpose/identity from the homepage
- Calls for a site search function
