# Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 6a

## What we’ve done

We designed this prototype in order test our:

Assumption - We think that users do not understand what steps to take in FE in terms of:

- What their existing qualifications enable them to do
- What qualifications they may need to take to be able to work in FE
- How they will go about gaining those qualifications

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Users need to compare qualifications
- Users need to understand the detail of qualifications
- Users need to understand the practical implications of different qualifications
- Users need to be able to differentiate between qualifications
- Users are overwhelmed with detailed information & unfamiliar vocab when trying to understand qualifications
- Users are apt to circulate through resources repeatedly to research qualifications (amongst other areas)
- Users may are apt to consider more than one subject - at least initially
- Users orient strongly towards PGCE (without appreciating different versions thereof)
- Users are unsure of imposed subject categories (“Is psychology included in this definition of science?”)
- Location for London-based participants was a far lesser concern than for previous provincial participants
- Users do not appreciate the distinction between FE teaching qualification and other-age teaching qualifications (particularly PGCE)
- Consideration is not just about qualifications in isolation
- Users are apt to resort to memory aids as part of researching qualifications (pen and paper)
- We cannot capture the full research experience in testing
- Some users see PGCE as ‘superior’ (kudos)
- Users called to know who was producing the site/information
- Details of a stepped journey were problematic in detail (but welcomed as a suggestion of a process)
- Accordion presentation of qualification details tested poorly (although bulleted logic peared to work well)
- Bullet point presentation of qualification details was inconclusive  (but better than in 5b)
- Page order in 6a (Qualifications vs Ways to Train) appeared unhelpful
- Use of modulated colour tested well
- Users appeared to find it difficult to visually distinguish between qualifications
- Delineating users by having a degree or not confused in this arrangement
- Delineating users by degree appeared to steer users towards a PGCE
- Description of what levels enable was apt to confuse (PhD, L5, PGCE)
- QTS, QTLS caused some confusion
- 6a Design appeared not to trigger assumptions of progressive qualification levels as a requirement
- Mismatch of presented ‘steps’ and header menu appeared to confuse
- Steps as a symbol of a process landed well
- Names of steps was seen as unhelpful
- Call for mirroring of step titles with Nav (if that’s what’s happening)
- Link to AoC job site seen as insufficient to meet description of ‘types of role available’
- Steps and their labels appeared to trigger diverse reactions
- Qualification titles without associated acronyms was liable to confuse

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

- Do users react differently to a ‘warm’ colour scheme?
- Do users react differently to subtle iterations to the CTA design?
- Iterated steps feature on the landing page
- GDS-inspired drop down accordion organisation of the teaching qualiifcations within FE
- Ways to train page
