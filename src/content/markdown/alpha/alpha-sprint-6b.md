#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 6b

##What we’ve done

We designed this prototype in order to test our:

Assumption - We think that users do not understand what steps to take in FE in terms of:

- What their existing qualifications enable them to do
- What qualifications they may need to take to be able to work in FE
- How they will go about gaining those qualifications

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- DfE badge appeared to test well
- Bursaries distract attention from primary information goals
- Re-occurrence of the idea that quals levels have to be done in order
- Three column tables are challenging for some P39
- Steps interpreted as links
- Interaction/access prob: identical links on nav and steps go to different things
- Placement of Specialist Areas info confused/distracted
- PGCE jump link disturbs nav/obscures useful info
- Users appear to want to compare L5 and PGCE side by side
- Users are apt to say they’ll phone for support for wildly different reasons

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

- Tables, contents and quick links as a way of organizing information surrounding FE teaching qualifications
