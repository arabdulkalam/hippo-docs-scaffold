#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 5a

##What we’ve done

We designed this prototype in order:

Define the information & layout that users need about job opportunities 

Test our risky assumption that we think that users do not understand the opportunities available in FE

Why we’ve focused on this now:

Routes into to better understand next steps for FE users. So far we have spent more time on content and navigation to understand what FE is, earlier in the FE information journey. 

The 'hopping off point’ to opportunities is a critical part of the overall journey.

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

Committed participants are highly proactive

Committed participants seek information from numerous sources

Committed users are exposed to responsive GiT marketing material

Committed users make direct enquiries to their local colleges

Locality is still a key determinant

Some users are uncertain about beginning a ‘formal’ discussion

Direct exposure to assessor roles shapes opinion

Committed job seekers are more comfortable with ‘teaching’ vocabulary than those less committed 

Conversations with professionals (inc FE Advice) may still leave users with unanswered questions

Users are - to varying degrees - anxious or uncertain about what the process of getting into FE involves

Users are to varying degrees - anxious or uncertain about what teaching in FE involves

For committed researchers, salary questions appear to be less salient 

Part time first positions are seen as a potential fist stepping stone route into teaching for some

Some users assume there is a seasonal recruitment pattern
 
Users are apt to view teaching (and hence FE teaching) posts as stable and secure.

Users ask how much qualifications cost

Users ask how long it takes to qualify

Users orient very quickly to suggestions that there may be financial help to train/qualify

Users are keen to learn if there is a way to earn/work whilst qualifying

Users gravitate to content/links that mention funding assistance

PGCE is the default point of reference for users. They are apt to see this as the be-all and end-all

Some users are hesitant when confronted with academic/vocational distinction

Use of images may usefully suggest vocational/academic distinction 

Some users are sensitive to the academic/vocational split as this may imply one is in some way inferior

Job searches are likely to be subject specific

“Basic teaching qualification” is not well understood

⅔ users reacted positively to college invitation to informal meet up

One user reacted positively to the juxtaposition of ‘classroom’ FE and ‘on the job’ FE

Elements of gov.uk L&F evoked a sense of confidence that users were getting the right info

2 users noted that they’d primarily want to filter jobs by location

Content was described at various points as being overly generalised

Users felt there was still a lot left to be desired in terms of specific information

Users reassured by informal language

Mention of prison as a venue for FE was provocative

One user said they’d be annoyed if the language was inconsistent between academic and vocational info

FE Advice staff indicated users need a launch pad for their next steps

FE Advice staff indicated that users are appreciative of speaking to ‘real’ practitioners

FE Advice staff indicated that users are apt to think qualification levels are sequential ie do level 3 then 5

FE Advice staff indicated that there is big crossover between pre-service and in-service in level 5 - much part time. And this could be a point of friction with users

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

‘Opportunities’ page
‘FE 101’ page

###Our users told us:

‘FE101’ wasn’t understood well
