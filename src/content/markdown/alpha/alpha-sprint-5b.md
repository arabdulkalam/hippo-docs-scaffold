#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 5b

##What we’ve done

We designed this prototype in order to test our:

Assumption that users do not understand the information surrounding qualifications in the FE sector

and

Hypothesis that a clear concise breakdown of qualification levels will enable users to tell what level of qualification they need

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Users are curious to know what key terms mean – practically
- These users have a clearer understanding of “Further Education” than naïve users
- Location a key determinant of activity (training and jobs)
- Users are proactive and ready to contact providers direct for information- telephone/email
- Little tolerance for complexity or extended reading
- Very focussed on/distracted by discussion of money at all points: income, interruptions to income, training costs, bursaries
- Users repeatedly demand to know “What’s next?”, “What do I do now?”
- PGCE looms large in users’ expectations of qualifications

##Features that may be part of the MVP

##A feature we tested was:

Content, structure and formatting of ‘Experience & qualifications’ page
Content, structure and formatting of ‘Is FE for me?’ page

##Our users told us:

Users need explanation of DfE terminology: levels & credits
Some users read levels as sequential – “I’ll do level 3, then level 4” etc
Users call for information about practicalities associated with qualifying (training duration, cost)
Users repeatedly call for a next step (and some signposting) “What do I do now?”
Users struggled to distinguish between teaching qualifications and subject qualifications
In this context “qualifications” appears to be a neutral term
Presentation “Boring”, content “quite exciting”
