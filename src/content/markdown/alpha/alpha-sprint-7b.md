#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 7b

##What we’ve done

Our objective this sprint was to:

Explore and understand recently qualified FE teachers’ experience of getting into FE

- Test information presentation in prototype
- Comparison with what they used
- Ease of use
- Effect of DfE branding
- Effect of more marketizing visuals

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

-  Assumption of need to prequalify
-  Casual/passive research
-  Training provision varies in quality
-  Benefits of training while working aren’t just about money
-  Users find early work via agencies
-  Admin and pastoral demands surprise new teachers
-  Site purpose not clear
-  FE as headline term unhelpful
-  Look and feel appreciated and their rhetorical purpose understood
-  DfE logo too small, but positively received otherwise
-  “About FE” dropdown appeared to work well (more testing needed)
-  Magnifying glass search icon went unnoticed
-  “Find a job” page hard to read/ style. The presentation is also a break with previously broken up text
-  Mention of “Regulated” adds nothing and disturbs users’ sense of security
-  Qualifications (not revised) still problematic - various
-  Mini menu [quals /teaching quals] appeared unproblematic
-  Content options on quals not entirely clear (1 user)
-  Explainers + links appreciated
-  Tables tested well
-  Navigation of Quals page (scrolling) difficult
-  Specialist areas content confuses (again)
-  Side by side comparisons land well
-  Relative importance of /ordering of table rows: no set pattern to user preferences
-  Copy under “Full teaching qualifications” appears to confuse/distract
-  Search icon (magnifying glass) unnoticed
-  Help and advice offer well received
-  Live chat and phone both appear popular/viable
