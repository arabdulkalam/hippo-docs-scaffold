# Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 3

## What we’ve done

We designed this prototype in order:

1) Test the GDS look and feel of the site for user research feedback
2) See if the sort of information that we were providing users was relevant and easy to understand from our labelling and information architecture

We gathered the content and initial needs for this from the user research conducted in Discovery and we also completed some initial research with 4 users (digital industry experts) around key information they would need in order to decide on a career change into Further Education teaching. 

We also looked into other services such as Get into Teaching and their personas and user needs in order to formulate this content as a first pass and to validate what our users would need. 

We then conducted research with a further 4 users to compare our prototype with National Careers Service and Get into Teaching to glean more information about the content and the GDS look and feel. 

User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

Users are not necessarily minded to search for a resource that describes the entire sector

Branding

      Faith expressed in .gov linearity [manageable steps, secure process]
      
      Assurance of .gov sanctioned information seen positively and wholly trusted
      
Filtering of information

      Speed with which users moved from one point of focus to another was marked
      
      Scanning and filtering rather than sifting: Users preferred to select between headline items, rather than sift through text for information relevant to themselves
      
Ordering

      Calls for an early overview of what FE means/entails
      
      Personal qualities and attributes (and hence opportunities) repeatedly suggested as something that should come ahead of formal qualifications
      
Locality

      Search for local opportunities, including jobs pages was recurrent
      
Making it ‘real’ (dynamic) was called out positively from Get into Teaching

      Case studies, videos and images were seen as ‘making it real’, personable and attractive
      
Language

      Teaching/lecturing/professing: inconsistency (and some self-consciousness) of use
      
 Identity shifting – interpellation of users as career changers questioned
 
      One user reacted to NCS as though it was calling on her to stop being a hairdresser and to become a more formal ‘stuffy’ educator

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

1) Gov.uk digital design look & feel
2) Information architecture based around identified user needs

Our users told us:

Users expressed faith expressed in gov.uk linearity [manageable steps, secure process]

Users expressed assurance in gov.uk sanctioned information and it was seen positively and wholly trusted

Users scanned and filtered rather than sifted

      Users preferred to select between headline items, rather than sift through text for information relevant to themselves
      
Users called for an early overview of what FE means/entails
