#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 4b

##What we’ve done

1. We think that a separate website from 'Get into Teaching' will provide more relevant information about teaching FE

2. We think this is because the users we're trying to attract have different needs and motivations to the 'Get into Teaching' target audience

3. So if we create a separate site from GIT 

4. Then we will see that user needs will be more closely met than on GIT  

##User research

1. Users are apt to describe Get into Teaching site as aimed at younger adults

2. Within a space dominated by “teaching” FE has low salience

3. Tabs that link back to generic teaching are unhelpful

4. Users call for some steerage / stepped journey

5. “Teaching” connotes negatively for some of our users and unhelpfully for our purposes

6. Users do not see  connections between their practical experience and FE opportunities: For some this revelation is a lightbulb moment

7. There is a strong presumption that higher level qualifications are a pre-requirement

8. Qualifications are apt to be treated as a quick filter

9. “Unregulated” carries unwelcome associations for some

10. Salary is measured against current rates of pay

11. Training/coaching/mentoring are described as a popular aspect of people’s past jobs

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

How are naïve users’ orientation to Further Education affected by a journey predicated on Get into Teaching?

###Our users told us:

Only 1/5 oriented to the ‘Teach in Further Education’ nav link naturally.

      ...

Instead what we saw was a combination of mental models fixed on what ‘teaching ‘ is, how little in these people’s minds the words “Further Education” resonated

What we saw was participants with no reason to orient to ‘FE’

Unhelpful connotations of ‘teaching’ were activated by GiT presentation

These participants had not been academically inclined at school and had a view of ‘teaching’ as not for them – as evidenced in 4a sessions

These were compounded by a generational sense that GiT wasn’t aimed at them

The assumption of a high bar to entry, meant it was effectively screened out of users’ thinking

Users were accepting of headline options but, once in an FE space they anticipate that these links will refer specifically to options that describe FE steps, ways to train etc.

In a GiT hosted format these generic links refer back to the GiT user journey and information geared towards that. This is unhelpful for those seeking FE specific information

users were distracted, if not put off, by the strong emphasis on school teaching and the impression that GiT is targeted towards what was perceived as young audience

The numbered and labelled steps was a design feature borrowed from an earlier version of GiT.  It appeared to work usefully and reassuringly for users when presented as part of 4a.

The numbered and labelled steps was a design feature borrowed from an earlier version of GiT.

We saw some hesitation as users were obliged to consider the different options offered in the pink dropdowns.

Images connote strongly

      We have not explored the degree to which the styling of GiT is suggestive of a particular readership/public BUT on the basis that it’s colour palette is quite striking and that the use of cartoon imagery is quite playful, we assume this contributes to the sense of a younger readership.

Overt debunking of assumptions about post graduate qualification levels was well received

“What support is available to me”  was not interpreted as being about financial support.

      Additionally, P18 clearly had no understanding of what “Bursaries” meant

P19 expressed limited tolerance for generalised content… which leads to the design question: how do we provide a resource that describes all of FE whilst meeting the demand for specificity?

      “I don’t want to be looking through mountains of information that I don’t need. You want the highlights and overview rather that all the detail.”

      Something like ‘this is what the role is, this is what you’ll get paid and this is how long it’ll take to get there’. P19
