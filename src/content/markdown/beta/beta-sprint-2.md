##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Smart Answer drop down: wording of options confused
- Smart answer introduction: copy tested well
- “Do you want to be able to teach in secondary?” option confused/distracted
- Subject specific quals: explanation/link re Level 3 called for
- Subject specific quals: Users suggested length of experience greater than the 3 years described in copy is preferable
- Subject specific Quals: list items not all-inclusive
- Subject specific Quals: (& not just this section) vocational teachers use the word ‘trade’
- Landing page: You do not need a degree message well received - particularly by non-graduates
- Nav bar: Ways to train given very little attention: IS FE for me? And quals much more attended to
- Buttons at the bottom of qualification tables - varied and diverse response to what users expected to be there
- Qualification Acronyms - users unfamiliar with FE didn’t understand acronyms
- Qualification tables: Full vs partial qualifications - users were unclear with what is meant by “full qualification” and difference between different qualifications
- Qualifications: Names - some participants found it difficult to find their own qualification in the tables
- Smart answer dropdown - Inconsistent description of levels (some do, some don’t)
- General: Users unsure what a ‘full’ teaching qualification means
- Inconsistent message: “You might not need a qual” on Is FE for Me? At odds with descriptions of quals elsewhere
- Smart Choices - Drop down not inclusive enough
