#Prototype - Beta - Sprint 8

##What we’ve done

Sprint Objectives

- To see how users navigate and use the site organically ie without being steered towards any particular feature or any particular task. Journeys were determined by interests declared in session preamble - e.g. if user suggests a need to find out about qualifications, they were oriented to that as a task.
- Test iterations to nav bar and revamped Is FE for ME?/ A Guide to Further Education section

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- 6/8 users missed the main navigation
- Site proposition - do user’s descriptions chime with policy objectives for the site?
- Number of images on site (user was on a mobile)
- Skills-focused content nearly loses a prospective FE English teacher
- Learning support assistants as opposed to ‘teaching assistants’
- Levels you can teach based on your subject quals
- Range of other tasks to perform
- Salaries for qualified and unqualified 
- Subject list - still leaves some users struggling to see how their specialism fits in
- Find a provider - users interested in this option
- Rosiness vs realness (users were generally preferable to the latter)
- Users were interested in clicking on provider search 
- ‘Online information can be out of date’
- Users want specific/tailored next steps - they want to speak to a person about it
