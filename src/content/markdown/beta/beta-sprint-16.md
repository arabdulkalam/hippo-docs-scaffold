#Prototype - Beta - Sprint 16

##What we’ve done

Sprint Objectives

- Check users’ priority information requirements
- Test menu in footer design (as failsafe for users missing mobile menu)
- Explore users’ requirement for Next Steps advisory content
- Validate earlier findings
  - Find a Job content
  - Subjects page
  - Where to Start - wording on nav
  - Where to start page content

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

Information priority

- Pay, conditions and benefits is the number one priority for users
- Top priorities linked to “Eligibility, Viability and Attractiveness”.
- Users are looking for “permission” or assurance that FE teaching is right for them. 
- Mixed success in finding KEY information across the site as placement is sometimes fragmented (e.g. Pay, conditions and Benefits across three areas)
- Users tended to have a positive reaction when they found financial information of interest - e.g. “27k to 34K that’s good!…”
- Users leveraged financial information as an indicator of viability for teaching in FE and want to confirm this early in their journey.

Footer as an aid to navigation

- Footer menu interaction is user dependent. 
- Some users engaged with the footer, others did not. 
- Mainly becomes relevant if/when users get to the bottom of the page - Lots of scrolling
- Others not using it - preferring to navigate “chronologically” via in page links 
- Some elements of the footer menu did not meet expectations (e.g. content and visual) 
- Content expectation set by comparing to similar websites
- More User testing needed
