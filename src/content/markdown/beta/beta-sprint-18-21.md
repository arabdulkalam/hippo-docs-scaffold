##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- No RED FLAGS identified by users with the launch spec website
- Users reacted overwhelmingly positively to the launch spec website and campaign video
- Users experience strong consistency between the campaign video and website in both image recognition, messaging and core sentiments.
- The “Change lives, not your career” main campaign message tested will with users and there was a clear compression of the premise and appeal that the message aims to convey.
- Some users were confused with multiple training pathways, and although indicated an understanding of what the phrase “TOTJ” means, a more detailed analysis revealed many specifics of the pathway were not understood.
- The MENU naming structure was enhanced over MVP to support the users under-served need to understand “HOW” to become an FE teacher.
- The TOTJ simplification exercise showed strong results, users leveraged the EXAMPLE to recognise and identify how to start the process.
- Examples need to be leveraged cautiously and false preconceptions dismantled to avoid example feeling un-relatable.  
- Some users found the images “BASIC” in nature and did not agree that the site was ‘EXCITING” but not the the point of detriment or detraction
- Although improvement could be made with the sites visual appearance, users rated “EXCITEMENT” as the lowest priority attribute they needed from the website.
- Users awareness of FE teaching was high for those considering a transition into teaching, however many users had inaccurate preconceived understandings of the sector and the proposition of getting a teaching job, and getting qualified while employed was new to many users. 
- No degree needed, part time opportunities and no fees are all elements that help users break down barriers and address concerns that allow them to identify the pathway as a positive one. 
- Salaries are clearly communicated but further enhancement could centre around “costs” and that FE teaching could be the simplest and most affordable way for many potential teachers to enter the profession.
- Users need personalised information and support to continue their journey and many users struggled significantly with the links provided to find colleges and learning providers. 
- Although this is largely a technical limitation users would benefit significantly if a tool was developed that allowed users to see if there were job opportunities, for their specific skill or profession, nearby. 
- Messages within the campaign video may set expectations with users that “part time” opportunities are workable around their current job commitments (e.g evening, weekends)… this may or may not be accurate based on how colleges and LP’s structure their courses. Further research with colleges may be needed to understand if there is a misaligned expectations between colleges and users.
