- User mistook multiple search returns for single result return

- “This might be the wrong qualification…”
- “This might be the wrong qualification…” 1 user complained of lack of direction from results
- Calls for comparison matrix

- Users expect site to deliver info on teacher training courses/resources (and no more)
- User need to be able to find out where they can get teaching quals
