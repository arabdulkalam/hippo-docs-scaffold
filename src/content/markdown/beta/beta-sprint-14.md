#Prototype - Beta - Sprint 14

##What we’ve done

Sprint Objectives

- Continue testing nav (mobile & desktop)
- Test out in-service & pre-service journeys, including users navigation and understanding
- Test “Colleges and Training Providers” wording

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Arranging information by Train on the Job/Train in Your Own Time isn’t working
- Main menus not seen (& so users struggle for orientation)
- Main menu seen but initially ignored
- Menu items fail to tell users where to find key info: eligibility, teaching quals, training, subjects
- First link on landing page, ”Many people start a job…” takes users in too deep too early, often leaving them confused
- Repeat (mild) observation that the Guide page is over-long
- Naive users who do not read Guide, struggle for an overview (from Train on job)
- Users who are shown Guide after having missed it, appear to learn from it and appreciate it
- ‘Too many’ in line links distract from consumption of content
- Links away from TiFE site can distract and confuse
- “Colleges and Training Providers” wording not 100% clear
- In line link to ‘popular courses’ may confuse
- “Full teaching qualification” meaning not clear
- Landing page description of ‘Many people start…’ seen as less than frank
- Landing page: Framing of not needing a teaching qual, many people starting w’out a degree or teaching qual - seen to be confusing/ambiguous
- Description of course length unclear
- “Assessment of Your English Maths and ICT skills” in tables unclear
- Uncertainty over “Significant career experience
- ⅖ spontaneously called for some sort of filter tool. But never saw the calculator
- Users assume term dates as schools/universities
- Lower portion of landing page largely ignored / scrolled past
- Users anticipate Help and Advice will appear at page foot
- Users bypass DET information in tables in favour of (more familiar) PGCE
- Tables layout and content enables users clarity
- This is for you/not for you if… content enables understanding
- Call for more imagery in some text-heavy sections
