##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Qualifications in nav bar:  drop down menu wording confuses users
- Is FE for me? Nav bar item: User points out this does not specify teaching
- The odd user unclear of the overall purpose of the site
- Order of nav bar items appears unproblematic
- “Earn a qualification” [landing page text] spontaneously disfavoured by 2/6
- “Your employer” [landing page text] confused ⅙ (and had been cited in earlier rounds)
- Drop downs in Is FE for ME? Understood nav items
- Drop downs in IS FE for ME? Seen as visually out of step with landing page
- Could I teach in FE dropdown section: Title and content seen to be not aligned by 3/6. It seems the current prompt is quite ambiguous - some read it as being about the individual’s soft skills, others as a way to talk about working circumstances/conditions, others think qualifications are being cued
- In IS FE for Me? Users call to be able to see local colleges.
- What’s teaching in FE like? Dropdown - users complained at not seeing what they’d expected. The listed activities were not well received. 
- Speech bubbles and images attract /distract attention.
- Playing these items below text appeared to draw attention away from the text (if presented after the text)
- Reactions to case studies generally positive  but care needed over specific info described
- Vocational Roles and Academic roles objected to
- Partial lists of subjects to teach recognised as incomplete… but slowly.
- Some users’ initial reading was that this was a closed list
- Users’ expressed disquiet if their subject was not shown in presented sample lists (under What Roles? tab)
- Drop down - “Is there any career progression?” seen as being too far off to be needed by 4/6
- Content of ‘career progression’ seen as minimal and unattractive

- Users have vague or inaccurate understanding of “Further Education”
- Early considerers are not necessarily fixed on any one subject. 
- Early considerers are apt to consider studying as well as teaching
