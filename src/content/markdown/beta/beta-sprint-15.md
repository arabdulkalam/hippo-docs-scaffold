#Prototype - Beta - Sprint 15

##What we’ve done

Sprint Objectives

- Establish users’ priority information goals (card sort)
- Test new page content: What you could teach, FInd a Job
- Test cut down Guide/Where to Start content
- Test revised main nav (desktop)

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

-   Users say they prioritise
  -   1 Quals info
  -   2 Pay info
  -   3 Subject info
  -   4 Practical ‘how to’ info
- In practice, Pay appears to be a first (filtering) question.
- Exploration of Subjects, appears to be superficial and more about reassurance / casual interest 
- Qualifications are treated with some hesitation. Users are aware they need ‘something’ but need a clear explanation of the options
- How to (Next steps) not always clear
- Mobile nav still not being seen/used
- Desktop nav appears to to be more salient
- Investigating users need a direct route to Pay info
- Investigating users need a direct route to teaching Quals info
- Changing menu label “Guide” to “Where to Start” appears to work
- Page content anchor links work well to aid nav. 
- Users spontaneously called for anchor link chapter headers by analogy with WtS
- Use of top banner as link to home page appeared familiar and unproblematic
- “Where to Start” tested well, no complaints re excessive scrolling, 
- Some uncertainty expressed around “See if you could teach” section”
- Mini chapter layout/breakdown of content tests well (understanding, retention, useful takeaways, navigation)
- “What you could Teach” page well received.
- “Find a job” well received - very positive reaction to content
- Content re FE being unregulated surprises and informs
- Complaints of high level, non specific information
- Bursary information ahead of quals information seen as illogical (again)
- Complaints of repetitive messaging (training)
- Question about status of FE qual in 6th form settings
- Users unsure of practical implications of different quals
