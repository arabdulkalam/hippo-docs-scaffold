#Prototype - Beta - Sprint 7

##What we’ve done

Sprint Objectives

- To see how users navigate and use the site organically ie without being steered towards any particular feature or any particular task. Journeys were determined by interests declared in session preamble - e.g. if user suggests a need to find out about qualifications, they were oriented to that as a task.

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Users describe the site as a ‘starting point’ (only)
- Landing page dead end
- Emotional Design thought: How do we manage users’ excitement from landing page
- Users apt to have multiple questions in play at the same time
- Users seeking answers to specific questions struggle to get direct answers
- Standalone text only links to testimonials ignored
- Testimonials prompt positive responses
- Users’ research around FE is a long-term, multi phase process, not restricted to the user alone
- Users tell us they are likely to revisit the site
- Compares to GiT as more official, informational, important
- .gov description of levels is clunky
- .Gov levels and job site links
- Recency and providence of qualifications seen as needing to be affirmed
- Bursary figure £26,000 seen as annual
- Reassurance around attention to disability seen as lacking
- Landing page images connote practicality and this is well received
- Users want to know what level they may teach at
- Some users are determined to pre-train
- There is no specific advice for returners (to teaching/FE or the workforce generally) within the site
