##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Navigation bar not recognised/used
- Without sight of Nav bar, users struggle to cross reference
- Users viewing qualification information ask about subjects to teach (+vice versa)
- Users assume they know FE - as distinct from FE teaching
- AoC link interpreted as being tailored to jobs offering in-service training
- Newsletter offer seen positively BUT with caution re spam
- Users think of the site as a full end-to-end, tailored service
- Users repeatedly call for information that relates specifically to their individual circumstances
- More invested participants ask more detailed and more specific questions
- Images criticised for not showing interaction
- Complaints that speech bubbles & associated images are repetitive
- Bursary information apt to confuse
- Bursary information contains unfamiliar info (Qualification types)
