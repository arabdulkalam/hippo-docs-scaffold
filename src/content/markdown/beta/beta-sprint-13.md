#Prototype - Beta - Sprint 13

##What we’ve done

Sprint Objectives

- Test mobile main nav
- Test re-ordered quals tables: from least to most onerous
- Test in-line links to Qualifications tables
- Test in-line links to Help and Advice and gauge how users will use them
- Check understanding of “Colleges & Training Providers”
- Check user understanding of subject agnostic training qualifications

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Main nav missed by ⅓ (mobile)
- In-line link to quals “Here’s a list of popular teacher training courses” makes users think of training courses rather than the quals that are actually linked
- In-line Help and Advice link working well - noticed and appreciated (Experience and Qualifications. Training and financial support
- First link on home page ignored (also by Analytics) “Many people start a job in further education (FE) without a degree or any teacher training.”
- Markedly different satisfaction correlates (it seems) with missing main nav
- Presentation of qualifications (in tables) in ascending order appeared to aid comprehensions
- Observations about the amount of text 
- too much uninterrupted reading and scrolling
  - Guide + Training and Financial support pages
- Implied complaint against extended page length / scrolling(Guide)
- Observations about how the text all looks alike 
  - ie a lack of visual differentiation (Guide)
- Observations about how some text items are not signposted as different 
  - ie a lack of semantic differentiation (quals listed)
- Observations about generic information that fails to meet individual users’ requirements
- ie content that describes only what may or may not be appropriate
- Complaint about conditional language “If, may, could" (Guide)
- Users seeking qualification information do not engage with calculator (when prompted, it is seen to be useful)
- Suggestion that ‘submit’ option on calculator is too final to be engaging
- Qual titles in intro to Quals breakdown overlooked
- Users struggle to separate the ideas of courses where they learn to teach from the qualifications needed to teach. 
- Confusion results.
- Those intending to teach show surprise at suggestion of L3 qualification requirement
- Users leave site to check what Level 3 qual is
- Meaning of “College and Training Provider” shown to be not entirely clear
