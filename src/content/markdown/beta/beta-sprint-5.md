##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Enlarged & simplified DfE logo (slide 22)
- Font identified as a marker of govt (23)
- H2 appears to sharpen user understanding of site purpose…. (24-25)
- … but it suggests a more restricted age-range than FE entails
- Users mention DfE/govt late in sessions (and don’t appear to get confused) (27)
- Messaging around ‘different routes in’ lands well in Help and Advice (30)
- Mention of prisons appears to add to appreciation of diversity (30)
- Mention of prisons does not distract unduly (as it did previously) (30)
- What is FE?  section tested well (33-36)
- Pay and Conditions and Find a job seen positively (37-41)
- Suggestion of specific age range of students be given
- ...But there appears to be some inconsistency in the description of student ages within FE (from landing page)
- “You do not need a degree” does not appear to disturb graduate users (43)
- A Day in the Life lacks ‘realness’(44-47)
- Title of Is FE for Me? Appears to trigger anticipation of two-way exchange that is not fully met (48)
- Nav bar link to Help and Advice is easily found (51)
- Help and advice presentation appreciated, but email alone seen as a poor offer (54)
- Users stress the need(s) to talk to someone (53)
- Users unsure of response time to email support (54)
- Visibility of email address called for, for follow up (55)
- Quals dropdown menu confuses users (57)
- “Your Work Experience” and qualifications seen as limited and uninspiring but useful (61)
- Visual inconsistency of landing page image framing pointed to (65)
- Some suggestion that same pages are visually lacking (66)
- Visual depiction of teaching called for (66)
- Critique of homepage layout (67)
- Written content well received: “Concise” a recurrent description (68)
- Overall tone of voice and presentation well received (69)
