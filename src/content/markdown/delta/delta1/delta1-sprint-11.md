##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

-  Users want to know minimum entry level qualifications
-  Users struggle to answer questions about teaching qualifications / find teaching quals info
-  Users questions around what is involved/required to teach are not answered at the point where they arise - instead (as above) they’re linked to ‘subjects’ - they get confused
-  Green ‘Start’ Button (for newsletter) confused as a more meaningful point of departure
-  Complaints about text-heavy presentation
-  No spontaneous interest in newsletter, and some critique of timing/value
-  Observation that bursary information preceding Qualification information was illogical/ unhelpful
-  Comparison of AET and CET in desktop version difficult to understand
-  Mid-page Help offer seen and oriented to usefully, BUT it was twice interpreted as signalling the end of the page (on mobile)
-  Single line of main nav (desktop) appears to attract more attention and use than when it extends over two lines
-  Benefits information seen to be unnecessary
-  Wording of Training on the job, and particularly “your employer” reference confused
-  Users call for a practical starting point for action - link to providers call described as potentially useful 
-  Exploration of job ads aided users’ practical understanding
