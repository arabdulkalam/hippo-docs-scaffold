content:
    main: Hello, world! This is just a test to see how 
    far we can go and build a suitable function which will only display the data that we need.
    And also, only display this when we need it.

#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 4a

##What we’ve done
-We designed this prototype in order:

To know what FE teaching is
To know what FE teaching would be like and if I can see myself doing it

Link to this version of the prototype: 

Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Iteration #2

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are\:

1) GiT users want to qualify in the knowledge that a job will derive from that:

    Our users want to know what actual vacancies are out there so they can work out whether/how they might qualify.

2) Relevant info needs to be findable/made obvious

    Identifiable steps facilitate that search is helpful only to explore known terms

3) Salary is measured against current pay

    Lifestyle fit is a major factor __Localness!__

4) Job ads are a source of reference

5) Ideal is for someone to talk to in detail: "about me"

6) Navigation requires help/signposting

7) Long term vision/job prospects called for

8) Teaching Qualifications are unknown

9) "Qualifications" for those without a degree can be daunting

10) Awareness of potential to teach professional skills is limited/unimagined

11) Talking about 'Further Education' is apt to conflate teacher training with teaching at 16+ in the context of qualifying to teach

12) Mental models of 'FE' are vague

13) Users expect to be be stimulated

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

### Do users find a ‘step-by-step’ beneficial?

To see if a hybrid of GiT and GDS L&F works for users
To see if patterns and components borrowed from GiT works for our users
What is users’ understanding of teaching in FE?
(mental models, gaps, misconceptions, salient knowledge, sources of ‘knowledge’)
What are the things users think they need to know about teaching in FE? 
(“What might it look like for me?”)
Filters - how do users react to filtering options?
What are users’ first points of inquiry?
What do users think is/isn’t possible?
How will positive exposition of ‘sales points’ will be seen?
How well is curiosity about FE satisfied?

###Our users told us:

A stepped journey was seen favourably as a way to chart through an unknown subject area: 
Also vocational/academic pathways were appreciated
Simplicity of  presentation (inc content) appreciated
“Unregulated” is a loaded and/or confusing term
Positive explanations  of what is achievable generate a sense of ‘can-do’
Users complain at lack of ‘excitement’ in terms of overall presentation
